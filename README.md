# Bitwise_operator_pratice
Bitwise operators are used in programming to perform operations on individual bits of binary numbers. These operators work at the bit level, manipulating bits directly within binary representations of data.

1) AND (&): Compares two bits and produces a result where the corresponding bits are set to 1 if both bits are 1, otherwise 0.
2) OR (|): Compares two bits and produces a result where the corresponding bits are set to 1 if at least one of the bits is 1
3) XOR (^): Exclusive OR operator produces a result where the corresponding bits are set to 1 if the bits are different, otherwise 0
4) NOT (~): Unary operator that flips the bits, turning 0 to 1 and 1 to 0
5) Left Shift (<<) and Right Shift (>>): Shift the bits in a binary number to the left or right by a specified number of positions.
